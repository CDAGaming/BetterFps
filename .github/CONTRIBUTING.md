## Issues
### Bugs / Questions
1. Specify the Minecraft Version
2. Specify the BetterFps Version
3. Specify the Forge/LiteLoader versions if you were using any of them
4. If there were any logs (crashes, warnings, etc), attach it to the issue (upload it through GitHub itself or in a Gist/Pastebin)
5. If there were any other mods, specify them (or a link to a mod list)
6. If the issue affects the game visually, a screenshot/video helps a lot.

For versions, don't specify "latest", as it can be updated anytime.
Also, each mod has their own version, specify it correctly.
Keep in mind that in a single Minecraft version, there might be more than one BetterFps/Forge/LiteLoader version
